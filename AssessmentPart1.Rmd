For this assignment, I decided to experiment with different ways of mapping football fan culture across England and Wales with the ArcGIS map, and focusing on London in my R map. I wanted to see if I could create a sense of which clubs have the least and best behaved fan groups. To do this I worked with two different data sets, one from the data.gov.uk which recorded football fan arrests of 140 English and Welsh clubs from 2014 to 2017 (https://data.gov.uk/dataset/e74d7ef0-ac2a-46c6-802a-935882284bab/statistics-on-football-related-arrests-and-football-banning-orders) and another from doogal which gave coordinates for football grounds and their capacities across the UK (https://www.doogal.co.uk/FootballStadiums.php).

Since I had severe compatibility issues attempting to join the two excel databases within ArcGIS, I combined this data into a single table in excel and added a column which averaged the total arrests per club over the 3 years and scaled this to stadium size per club to create a metric of how rowdy fans are relative to the size of the club. There are a few limitations with this approach. Firstly the data on arrests does not provide a big enough sample size over a long enough time to get a true reflection of historical fan behaviour. Likewise arrests probably depend greatly on factors such as the amount of derby games played and the division clubs are in, potentially affecting the result. Lastly, stadium size does not always correlate with the true size of the fan base. However despite the absence of deeper data on the subject, I was able to give an indication of where, and how numerous the worst behaved football fans in are. The fact that Millwall ranked worst for arrests per club size in my metric should come as no surprise to followers of English Football.

#Workflow, discussion and comparison of the two mapping approaches

Making the London map with R:

To begin with I focused on London and tried to see which boroughs contained local teams with the unruliest fans. First cleaned and imported a csv database containing teams, boroughs, borough ID’s and arrests per stadium size. When I ran the code to access my data (#FootballData <- read_csv("Boroughs_and_clubs.csv")) and tried to amend it to the shapefile, I had the issue that the City of London data was not in table which caused the operation to fail. While it is possible to make edits to dataframes directly in R I found it simpler to amend the original table and reupload. GIS tools like ARC seem to make it easier to check and clean data tables on the fly.
The biggest issue I had with R was that the OpenStreetMap library was not importing, preventing my from styling my map. After searching online for why I realised I had to reinstall Java.

This problem was not too hard to find the solution for but it might need to be added into the Github commits to warn other potential users of the code if they have the same issue. I spent a while searching for how to edit the default OpenStreetMap baselayer but couldn’t find anything online. However there is potential, having exported and shared the code on an open source platform, for others to help improve your software and easily reproduce it themselves. Perhaps this is both R’s greatest strength over ArcGIS but also a weakness. Maps made in R are much stronger when shared but are harder to produce alone than in tools such as Arc.

The map of stadia across England, scaled by size and coloured according to the aforementioned ‘fan violence index’ was produced in ArcGIS. After adding a base layer and adding the coordinates for the various stadia I had mapped something basic much quicker than I was able to in R. For a beginner to GIS tools such as Arc provide a lower entry barrier. However that is not to say that they are not fiddly. After importing the arrests table I hit an error when trying to join the two CSV datasets together.

After a very long time of trial and error and fruitlessly searching manuals, I realised that the error was due to the tables being different types of CSV file. After converting the latter table to CSV UTF-8 they could now join. This table was originally in ODS format and didn’t convert correctly. It’s a little disappointing that ArcGIS is so particular with its file formats and automatically converting to a format which would work seems an expected feature of modern software. Arc is perhaps becoming a little outdated.

Arc’s interface is also not particularly intuitive. It took a lot of trial and error to figure out how to use to use two different attributes for one symbol. The trick was to click ‘add values’ not ‘add all values’ which seems a little obtuse. Nonetheless, one you navigate it’s intricacies it’s easy to repeat functions or models for different situations. In this sense perhaps it has more flexibility than R which may require rewriting code for different maps. If you need to make lots of different maps quickly then Arc may hold an advantage whilst the ability to allow many people produce the same map lies with R.
